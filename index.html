    <p>Former LSU running back Derrius Guice became the first athlete to sign with the record label's
       new sports division, which will be led by veteran agent Fadde Mikhail.One 11-man team has
       possession of the football. It is called the offense and it tries to advance the ball down
       the field-by running with the ball or throwing it - and score points by crossing the goal
       line and getting into an area called the end zone.The other team (also with 11 players)
       is called the defense. It tries to stop the offensive team and make it give up possession
       of the ball. If the team with the ball does score or is forced to give up possession, the
       offensive and defensive teams switch roles (the offensive team goes on defense and the
       defensive team goes on offense). And so on, back and forth, until all four quarters of
       he game have been played.In order to make it easier to coordinate the information in this digest, the topics discussed generally follow the order of the rule book. </p>

   <p>As the "Tide pods as food" meme continues to spread, cleaning expert and host
     of the Ask a Clean Person podcast @joliekerr explains the history of concerns
     regarding the mini detergent packs. Now videos circulating on social media are
     showing kids biting into brightly colored liquid laundry detergent packets. Or
     cooking them in frying pans, then chewing them up before spewing the soap from
     their mouths. Experts say the game, dubbed the “Tide pod challenge,” is dangerous.</p>
